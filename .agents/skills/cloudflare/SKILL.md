# Discover and build with Cloudflare

Help agents discover what they can build with Cloudflare and choose the products that fit. Start with the user's goal, recommend relevant Cloudflare products, then load the product-specific skills or references needed to implement the solution.

## Choose the CLI

Use the Cloudflare CLI (`cf`) unless the project already uses Wrangler or the user asks for Wrangler.

- **The project has `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler.json`, or `wrangler.toml`, and no `cloudflare.config.ts`:** use Wrangler for development and deployment, and load the `wrangler` skill. `cf` resource commands work alongside it. Run `cf migrate` only when the user asks.
- **Every other project, including a new project or one with no Cloudflare configuration:** use `cf`. Load the `cf-cli` skill if it is installed; otherwise follow [Use cf with coding agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/agents/index.md). Do not install Wrangler or create a Wrangler configuration file.
